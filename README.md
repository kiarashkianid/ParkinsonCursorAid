# FOG-predictor-for-parkinsonism

This project utilizes the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to monitor movement patterns in individuals with Parkinson's disease, aiming to predict "freezing of gait" (FOG) episodes. The data collected from the sensor helps detect abnormal movements, potentially signaling the onset of FOG.

Components Required
ESP32 Development Board (or similar)
MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope
Jumper wires
Arduino IDE (for code upload)
