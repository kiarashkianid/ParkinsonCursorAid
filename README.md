using a diffusion model the script will predict and fix the error on cursor movement due to hand termors in parkinsonism patients 

Hand tremors in Parkinson’s disease are involuntary, rhythmic muscle movements that cause shaking in the hands. These tremors typically occur at rest and are one of the hallmark symptoms of Parkinsonism. They result from dysfunction in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain responsible for coordinating movement.  

### **Types of Hand Tremors in Parkinson’s Disease**  
1. **Resting Tremor** – Occurs when the hand is at rest and often diminishes with movement. It usually starts in one hand and progresses over time.  
2. **Action Tremor** – Occurs when the person is actively using their hands, such as when reaching for an object or using a computer mouse.  
3. **Postural Tremor** – Happens when the hand is held against gravity, like when extending an arm forward.  

### **Impact on Cursor Control**  
- Tremors cause unintended cursor movements, making it difficult to click small buttons or navigate smoothly.  
- The erratic motion can lead to frequent misclicks, frustration, and reduced digital accessibility.  
- Traditional mouse smoothing or sensitivity adjustments often do not fully compensate for the tremors.  

### **How ParkinsonCursorAid Helps**  
By using a **diffusion model**, the script predicts the user’s intended cursor movement and filters out tremor-induced deviations. This improves accuracy, making digital interactions easier for individuals with Parkinson’s.
